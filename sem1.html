                        I believe each failure brings us one step closer to success. Itâ€™s better to make as many mistakes as I did before I made it into society. For example, I will try stepping into various fields in the computer science field. Explore the difference and expand my overall knowledge in computer science. Finally, I will make my decision on which field is my favourite depending on the rewardless and happiness and dive deep into it. Therefore, I would focus my efforts on my passion for becoming successful.
